### A script to setup few cli utilities to work with the gtk-kn project in a dir-agnostic way
### Commands:
###   croot - change to project's root
###   gomod - go to a given module
###   gw - execute gradle wrapper at project root from current directory

CONFIG="$(exec 2>/dev/null;cd -- $(dirname "$0"); unset PWD; /usr/bin/pwd || /bin/pwd || pwd)"
ROOT="$(dirname $CONFIG)"

alias croot="cd $ROOT"
alias gw="$ROOT/gradlew"

function gomod() {
  if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
    printf "%s\n" "Modules:"
    for c in $(find $ROOT -type d -printf '%p\n'); do
      if [[ -f "$c/build.gradle.kts" ]]; then
        name="$(basename $c)"
        printf "\t%-20s%s\n" "$name" "$c"
      fi
    done
  else
    for c in $(find . -type d -name "$1" -printf '%p\n' |
      sort -n -k 1); do
      if [[ -f "$c/build.gradle.kts" ]]; then
        cd "$c" && return
      fi

    echo "Module $1 not found"
