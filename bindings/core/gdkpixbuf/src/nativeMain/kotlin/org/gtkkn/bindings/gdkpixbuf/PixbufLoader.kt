/**
 * Incremental image loader.
 *
 * `GdkPixbufLoader` provides a way for applications to drive the
 * process of loading an image, by letting them send the image data
 * directly to the loader instead of having the loader read the data
 * from a file. Applications can use this functionality instead of
 * `gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file()` or `gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file()`
 * when they need to parse image data in small chunks. For example,
 * it should be used when reading an image from a (potentially) slow
 * network connection, or when loading an extremely large file.
 *
 * To use `GdkPixbufLoader` to load an image, create a new instance,
 * and call [method@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader.write] to send the data
 * to it. When done, [method@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader.close] should be
 * called to end the stream and finalize everything.
 *
 * The loader will emit three important signals throughout the process:
 *
 *  - [signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::size-prepared] will be emitted as
 *    soon as the image has enough information to determine the size of
 *    the image to be used. If you want to scale the image while loading
 *    it, you can call [method@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader.set_size] in
 *    response to this signal.
 *  - [signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-prepared] will be emitted as
 *    soon as the pixbuf of the desired has been allocated. You can obtain
 *    the `GdkPixbuf` instance by calling [method@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader.get_pixbuf].
 *    If you want to use it, simply acquire a reference to it. You can
 *    also call `gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf()` later to get the same
 *    pixbuf.
 *  - [signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-updated] will be emitted every
 *    time a region is updated. This way you can update a partially
 *    completed image. Note that you do not know anything about the
 *    completeness of an image from the updated area. For example, in an
 *    interlaced image you will need to make several passes before the
 *    image is done loading.
 *
 * ## Loading an animation
 *
 * Loading an animation is almost as easy as loading an image. Once the
 * first [signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-prepared] signal has been
 * emitted, you can call [method@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader.get_animation] to
 * get the [class@GdkPixbuf.PixbufAnimation] instance, and then call
 * and [method@GdkPixbuf.PixbufAnimation.get_iter] to get a
 * [class@GdkPixbuf.PixbufAnimationIter] to retrieve the pixbuf for the
 * desired time stamp.
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation
 *
 * - parameter `buf`: Array parameter of type guint8 is not supported
