/**
 * `GObject` instance (or source) and another property on another `GObject`
 * instance (or target).
 *
 * Whenever the source property changes, the same value is applied to the
 * target property; for instance, the following binding:
 *
 * ```c
 *   g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
 *                           object2, "property-b",
 *                           G_BINDING_DEFAULT);
 * ```
 *
 * will cause the property named "property-b" of @object2 to be updated
 * every time [method@GObject.set] or the specific accessor changes the value of
 * the property "property-a" of @object1.
 *
 * It is possible to create a bidirectional binding between two properties
 * of two `GObject` instances, so that if either property changes, the
 * other is updated as well, for instance:
 *
 * ```c
 *   g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
 *                           object2, "property-b",
 *                           G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL);
 * ```
 *
 * will keep the two properties in sync.
 *
 * It is also possible to set a custom transformation function (in both
 * directions, in case of a bidirectional binding) to apply a custom
 * transformation from the source value to the target value before
 * applying it; for instance, the following binding:
 *
 * ```c
 *   g_object_bind_property_full (adjustment1, "value",
 *                                adjustment2, "value",
 *                                G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL,
 *                                celsius_to_fahrenheit,
 *                                fahrenheit_to_celsius,
 *                                NULL, NULL);
 * ```
 *
 * will keep the "value" property of the two adjustments in sync; the
 * @celsius_to_fahrenheit function will be called whenever the "value"
 * property of @adjustment1 changes and will transform the current value
 * of the property before applying it to the "value" property of @adjustment2.
 *
 * Vice versa, the @fahrenheit_to_celsius function will be called whenever
 * the "value" property of @adjustment2 changes, and will transform the
 * current value of the property before applying it to the "value" property
 * of @adjustment1.
 *
 * Note that #GBinding does not resolve cycles by itself; a cycle like
 *
 * ```
 *   object1:propertyA -> object2:propertyB
 *   object2:propertyB -> object3:propertyC
 *   object3:propertyC -> object1:propertyA
 * ```
 *
 * might lead to an infinite loop. The loop, in this particular case,
 * can be avoided if the objects emit the `GObject::notify` signal only
 * if the value has effectively been changed. A binding is implemented
 * using the `GObject::notify` signal, so it is susceptible to all the
 * various ways of blocking a signal emission, like [func@GObject.signal_stop_emission]
 * or [func@GObject.signal_handler_block].
 *
 * A binding will be severed, and the resources it allocates freed, whenever
 * either one of the `GObject` instances it refers to are finalized, or when
 * the #GBinding instance loses its last reference.
 *
 * Bindings for languages with garbage collection can use
 * [method@GObject.Binding.unbind] to explicitly release a binding between the source
 * and target properties, instead of relying on the last reference on the
 * binding, source, and target instances to drop.
