/**
 * The base object type.
 *
 * `GObject` is the fundamental type providing the common attributes and
 * methods for all object types in GTK, Pango and other libraries
 * based on GObject. The `GObject` class provides methods for object
 * construction and destruction, property access methods, and signal
 * support. Signals are described in detail [here][gobject-Signals].
 *
 * For a tutorial on implementing a new `GObject` class, see [How to define and
 * implement a new GObject](tutorial.html#how-to-define-and-implement-a-new-gobject).
 * For a list of naming conventions for GObjects and their methods, see the
 * [GType conventions](concepts.html#conventions). For the high-level concepts
 * behind GObject, read
 * [Instantiatable classed types: Objects](concepts.html#instantiatable-classed-types-objects).
 *
 * Since GLib 2.72, all `GObject`s are guaranteed to be aligned to at least the
 * alignment of the largest basic GLib type (typically this is `guint64` or
 * `gdouble`). If you need larger alignment for an element in a `GObject`, you
 * should allocate it on the heap (aligned), or arrange for your `GObject` to be
 * appropriately padded. This guarantee applies to the `GObject` (or derived)
 * struct, the `GObjectClass` (or derived) struct, and any private data allocated
 * by `G_ADD_PRIVATE()`.
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation

 * - method `add_weak_pointer`: In/Out parameter is not supported

     * Increases the reference count of the object by one and sets a
     * callback to be called when all other references to the object are
     * dropped, or when this is already the last reference to the object
     * and another reference is established.
     *
     * This functionality is intended for binding @object to a proxy
     * object managed by another memory manager. This is done with two
     * paired references: the strong reference added by
     * g_object_add_toggle_ref() and a reverse reference to the proxy
     * object which is either a strong reference or weak reference.
     *
     * The setup is that when there are no other references to @object,
     * only a weak reference is held in the reverse direction from @object
     * to the proxy object, but when there are other references held to
     * @object, a strong reference is held. The @notify callback is called
     * when the reference from @object to the proxy object should be
     * "toggled" from strong to weak (@is_last_ref true) or weak to strong
     * (@is_last_ref false).
     *
     * Since a (normal) reference must be held to the object before
     * calling g_object_add_toggle_ref(), the initial state of the reverse
     * link is always strong.
     *
     * Multiple toggle references may be added to the same gobject,
     * however if there are multiple toggle references to an object, none
     * of them will ever be notified until all but one are removed.  For
     * this reason, you should only ever use a toggle reference if there
     * is important state in the proxy object.
     *
     * Note that if you unref the object on another thread, then @notify might
     * still be invoked after g_object_remove_toggle_ref(), and the object argument
     * might be a dangling pointer. If the object is destroyed on other threads,
     * you must take care of that yourself.
     *
     * A g_object_add_toggle_ref() must be released with g_object_remove_toggle_ref().

     * If @object is floating, sink it.  Otherwise, do nothing.
     *
     * In other words, this function will convert a floating reference (if
     * present) into a full reference.
     *
     * Typically you want to use g_object_ref_sink() in order to
     * automatically do the correct thing with respect to floating or
     * non-floating references, but there is one specific scenario where
     * this function is helpful.
     *
     * The situation where this function is helpful is when creating an API
     * that allows the user to provide a callback function that returns a
     * GObject. We certainly want to allow the user the flexibility to
     * return a non-floating reference from this callback (for the case
     * where the object that is being returned already exists).
     *
     * At the same time, the API style of some popular GObject-based
     * libraries (such as Gtk) make it likely that for newly-created GObject
     * instances, the user can be saved some typing if they are allowed to
     * return a floating reference.
     *
     * Using this function on the return value of the user's callback allows
     * the user to do whichever is more convenient for them. The caller will
     * alway receives exactly one full reference to the value: either the
     * one that was returned in the first place, or a floating reference
     * that has been converted to a full reference.
     *
     * This function has an odd interaction when combined with
     * g_object_ref_sink() running at the same time in another thread on
     * the same #GObject instance. If g_object_ref_sink() runs first then
     * the result will be that the floating reference is converted to a hard
     * reference. If g_object_take_ref() runs first then the result will be
     * that the floating reference is converted to a hard reference and an
     * additional reference on top of that one is added. It is best to avoid
