/**
 * A #GStaticMutex works like a #GMutex.
 *
 * Prior to GLib 2.32, GStaticMutex had the significant advantage
 * that it doesn't need to be created at run-time, but can be defined
 * at compile-time. Since 2.32, #GMutex can be statically allocated
 * as well, and GStaticMutex has been deprecated.
 *
 * Here is a version of our give_me_next_number() example using
 * a GStaticMutex:
 * |[
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     static int current_number = 0;
 *     int ret_val;
 *     static GStaticMutex mutex = G_STATIC_MUTEX_INIT;
 *
 *     g_static_mutex_lock (&mutex);
 *     ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *     g_static_mutex_unlock (&mutex);
 *
 *     return ret_val;
 *   }
 * ]|
 *
 * Sometimes you would like to dynamically create a mutex. If you don't
 * want to require prior calling to g_thread_init(), because your code
 * should also be usable in non-threaded programs, you are not able to
 * use g_mutex_new() and thus #GMutex, as that requires a prior call to
 * g_thread_init(). In these cases you can also use a #GStaticMutex.
 * It must be initialized with g_static_mutex_init() before using it
 * and freed with with g_static_mutex_free() when not needed anymore to
 * free up any allocated resources.
 *
 * Even though #GStaticMutex is not opaque, it should only be used with
 * the following functions, as it is defined differently on different
 * platforms.
 *
 * All of the g_static_mutex_* functions apart from
 * g_static_mutex_get_mutex() can also be used even if g_thread_init()
 * has not yet been called. Then they do nothing, apart from
 * g_static_mutex_trylock() which does nothing but returning true.
 *
 * All of the g_static_mutex_* functions are actually macros. Apart from
 * taking their addresses, you can however use them as if they were
 * functions.
