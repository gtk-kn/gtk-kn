/**
 * The type of file to return the filename for, when used with
 * g_test_build_filename().
 *
 * These two options correspond rather directly to the 'dist' and
 * 'built' terminology that automake uses and are explicitly used to
 * distinguish between the 'srcdir' and 'builddir' being separate.  All
 * files in your project should either be dist (in the
 * `EXTRA_DIST` or `dist_schema_DATA`
 * sense, in which case they will always be in the srcdir) or built (in
 * the `BUILT_SOURCES` sense, in which case they will
 * always be in the builddir).
 *
 * Note: as a general rule of automake, files that are generated only as
 * part of the build-from-git process (but then are distributed with the
 * tarball) always go in srcdir (even if doing a srcdir != builddir
 * build from git) and are considered as distributed files.
 * @since 2.38
