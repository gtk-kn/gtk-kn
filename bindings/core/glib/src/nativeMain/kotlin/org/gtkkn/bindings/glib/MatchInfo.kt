     * example might be a date in the form ddmmmyy, defined by the pattern
     * "^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$".

     * check that what has been typed so far is potentially valid, it is
     * able to raise an error as soon as a mistake is made.

     * GRegex supports the concept of partial matching by means of the
     * %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_SOFT and %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_HARD flags.

     * g_regex_match() or g_regex_match_full() is, as usual, true
     * for a complete match, false otherwise. But, when these functions
     * return false, you can check if the match was partial calling
     * g_match_info_is_partial_match().
     *
     * The difference between %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_SOFT and
     * %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_HARD is that when a partial match is encountered
     * with %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_SOFT, matching continues to search for a
     * possible complete match, while with %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_HARD matching
     * stops at the partial match.
     * When both %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_SOFT and %G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL_HARD
     * are set, the latter takes precedence.
     *
     * There were formerly some restrictions on the pattern for partial matching.
