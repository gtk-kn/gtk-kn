/**
 * A `GTimeZone` represents a time zone, at no particular point in time.
 *
 * The `GTimeZone` struct is refcounted and immutable.
 *
 * Each time zone has an identifier (for example, ‘Europe/London’) which is
 * platform dependent. See [ctor@GLib.TimeZone.new] for information on the
 * identifier formats. The identifier of a time zone can be retrieved using
 * [method@GLib.TimeZone.get_identifier].
 *
 * A time zone contains a number of intervals. Each interval has an abbreviation
 * to describe it (for example, ‘PDT’), an offset to UTC and a flag indicating
 * if the daylight savings time is in effect during that interval. A time zone
 * always has at least one interval — interval 0. Note that interval abbreviations
 * are not the same as time zone identifiers (apart from ‘UTC’), and cannot be
 * passed to [ctor@GLib.TimeZone.new].
 *
 * Every UTC time is contained within exactly one interval, but a given
 * local time may be contained within zero, one or two intervals (due to
 * incontinuities associated with daylight savings time).
 *
 * An interval may refer to a specific period of time (eg: the duration
 * of daylight savings time during 2010) or it may refer to many periods
 * of time that share the same properties (eg: all periods of daylight
 * savings time).  It is also possible (usually for political reasons)
 * that some properties (like the abbreviation) change between intervals
 * without other properties changing.
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation

         * variable (including null).

         * In Windows, @identifier can also be the unlocalized name of a time
         * zone for standard time, for example "Pacific Standard Time".
         *
         * Valid RFC3339 time offsets are `"Z"` (for UTC) or
         * `"±hh:mm"`.  ISO 8601 additionally specifies
         * `"±hhmm"` and `"±hh"`.  Offsets are
         * time values to be added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to get

         * "std offset [dst [offset],start[/time],end[/time]]" (POSIX) format.
         * There  are  no spaces in the specification. The name of standard
         * and daylight savings time zone must be three or more alphabetic
         * characters. Offsets are time values to be added to local time to
         * get Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and should be
         * `"[±]hh[[:]mm[:ss]]"`.  Dates are either
         * `"Jn"` (Julian day with n between 1 and 365, leap
         * years not counted), `"n"` (zero-based Julian day
         * with n between 0 and 365) or `"Mm.w.d"` (day d
         * (0 <= d <= 6) of week w (1 <= w <= 5) of month m (1 <= m <= 12), day
         * 0 is a Sunday).  Times are in local wall clock time, the default is
         * 02:00:00.
         *
         * In Windows, the "tzn[+|–]hh[:mm[:ss]][dzn]" format is used, but also
         * accepts POSIX format.  The Windows format uses US rules for all time
         * zones; daylight savings time is 60 minutes behind the standard time
         * with date and time of change taken from Pacific Standard Time.
         * Offsets are time values to be added to the local time to get
         * Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
         *
         * g_time_zone_new_local() calls this function with the value of the
         * `TZ` environment variable. This function itself is independent of
         * the value of `TZ`, but if @identifier is null then `/etc/localtime`
         * will be consulted to discover the correct time zone on UNIX and the
         * registry will be consulted or GetTimeZoneInformation() will be used
         * to get the local time zone on Windows.
         *
         * If intervals are not available, only time zone rules from `TZ`
         * environment variable or other means, then they will be computed
         * from year 1900 to 2037.  If the maximum year for the rules is
