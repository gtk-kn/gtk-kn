/**
 * This class provides unit tests for the `MemoryCleaner` object.
 *
 * The purpose of these tests is to ensure that native memory management
 * for `Proxy` objects is handled correctly in various scenarios, including:
 *
 * 1. Ensuring owned memory is freed using the correct cleanup function
 *    (`g_free`, `g_boxed_free`, or custom free function) when the object
 *    is garbage-collected.
 * 2. Ensuring that non-owned memory is not automatically cleaned up.
 * 3. Verifying that custom cleanup functions work as intended.
 * 4. Testing the behavior of the `Cleaner` and garbage collection mechanism.
 *
 * ### Key Concepts:
 *
 * - **Ownership Semantics:** Determines if the memory associated with a proxy
 *   is cleaned up automatically when garbage-collected. Ownership is managed
 *   using `takeOwnership` and `yieldOwnership`.
 *
 * - **Cleaner:** A Kotlin/Native mechanism that performs cleanup when an
 *   associated object is garbage-collected.
 *
 * - **Mocked Native Functions:** Used to track calls to native cleanup
 *   functions (`g_free`, `g_boxed_free`), ensuring no real resources are
 *   allocated or freed.
 *
 * - **Wrapping Lambda:** Used to limit the scope of strong references,
 *   ensuring the garbage collector can collect the `ProxyInstance`.
 *
 * - **Forced Garbage Collection:** Uses `GC.collect()` and
 *   `performGCOnCleanerWorker()` to trigger garbage collection and
 *   cleaner execution.
