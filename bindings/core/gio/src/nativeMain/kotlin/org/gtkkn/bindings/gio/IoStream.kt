/**
 * `GIOStream` represents an object that has both read and write streams.
 * Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
 * but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
 * seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
 *
 * Examples of `GIOStream` objects are [class@Gio.SocketConnection], which represents
 * a two-way network connection; and [class@Gio.FileIOStream], which represents a
 * file handle opened in read-write mode.
 *
 * To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
 * with [method@Gio.IOStream.get_input_stream] and
 * [method@Gio.IOStream.get_output_stream].
 *
 * The `GIOStream` object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
 * way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the `GIOStream`
 * object alive. If the `GIOStream` object is freed it will be closed, thus
 * closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
 * always return `G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED` for all operations.
 *
 * To close a stream use [method@Gio.IOStream.close] which will close the common
 * stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
 * the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
 * substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
 * `GIOStream` may still be open. However, some streams may support
 * ‘half-closed’ states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
 *
 * Operations on `GIOStream`s cannot be started while another operation on the
 * `GIOStream` or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
 * read from the [class@Gio.InputStream] and write to the
 * [class@Gio.OutputStream] simultaneously (either in separate threads, or as
 * asynchronous operations in the same thread), but an application cannot start
 * any `GIOStream` operation while there is a `GIOStream`, `GInputStream` or
 * `GOutputStream` operation in progress, and an application can’t start any
 * `GInputStream` or `GOutputStream` operation while there is a `GIOStream`
 * operation in progress.
 *
 * This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
 * given [type@GLib.MainContext] (the thread-default context at the time the
 * operation was started), rather than entire streams being associated with a
 * single `GMainContext`.
 *
 * GIO may run operations on `GIOStream`s from other (worker) threads, and this
 * may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
 * as [class@Gio.BufferedInputStream] or [class@Gio.TlsConnection]. With such
 * wrapper APIs, application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped)
 * stream when the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such
 * operations may not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves
 * the base stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

     * to close will still return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
