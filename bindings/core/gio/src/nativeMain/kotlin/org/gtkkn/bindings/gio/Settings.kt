/**
 * The `GSettings` class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
 * application settings.
 *
 * Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
 * settings with `GSettings` is typically extremely fast: on
 * approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
 * [struct@GLib.HashTable] lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in
 * terms of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
 * for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
 * (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
 * case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
 * a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn’t
 * even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
 * only ever modify `GSettings` keys in response to explicit user action.
 * Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
 * made during startup — for example, when setting the initial value
 * of preferences widgets.  The built-in [method@Gio.Settings.bind]
 * functionality is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals
 * as a result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
 *
 * When creating a `GSettings` instance, you have to specify a schema
 * that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
 * values, as well as some other information.
 *
 * Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
 * are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
 * can also be ‘[relocatable](#relocatable-schemas)’, i.e. not equipped with
 * a fixed path. This is
 * useful e.g. when the schema describes an ‘account’, and you want to be
 * able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
 *
 * Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character (`/`)
 * and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
 * be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
 * library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
 * `/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/` and `/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/`.
 * Paths should not start with `/apps/`, `/desktop/` or `/system/` as
 * they often did in GConf.
 *
 * Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
 * restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
 * values as [struct@GLib.Variant], and allows any [type@GLib.VariantType] for
 * keys. Key names are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and `-`.
 * Furthermore, the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
 * with a `-`, and must not contain consecutive dashes.
 *
 * Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
 * localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
 * and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
 * `gettext-domain` attribute of the `<schemalist>` or `<schema>`
 * elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
 * the `<default>` element. The string which is translated includes all text in
 * the `<default>` element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
 *
 * The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
 * [locale category for
 * translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html#index-locale-categories-1).
 * The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
 * translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
 * XML comment immediately above the `<default>` element — it is recommended to
 * add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
 * implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
 * attribute can be set on the `<default>` element to disambiguate multiple
 * defaults which use the same string.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```xml
 *  <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
 *       GVariant serialization syntax.
 *       See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
 *  <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
 * ```
 *
 * Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
 * [struct@GLib.Variant]s (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or
 * runtime errors will occur.
 *
 * GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
 * by the [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html)
 * utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
 *
 * A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
 * [gschema.dtd](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/gschema.dtd)
 *
 * The [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html) tool expects schema
 * files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
 *
 * At runtime, schemas are identified by their ID (as specified in the
 * `id` attribute of the `<schema>` element). The convention for schema
 * IDs is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
 * e.g. `org.gnome.SessionManager`. In particular, if the settings are
 * for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
 * and schema ID should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
 * associated with one named application, the ID should not use
 * StudlyCaps, e.g. `org.gnome.font-rendering`.
 *
 * In addition to [struct@GLib.Variant] types, keys can have types that have
 * enumerated types. These can be described by a `<choice>`,
 * `<enum>` or `<flags>` element, as seen in the
 * second example below. The underlying type of such a key
 * is string, but you can use [method@Gio.Settings.get_enum],
 * [method@Gio.Settings.set_enum], [method@Gio.Settings.get_flags],
 * [method@Gio.Settings.set_flags] access the numeric values corresponding to
 * the string value of enum and flags keys.
 *
 * An example for default value:
 * ```xml
 * <schemalist>
 *   <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
 *
 *     <key name="greeting" type="s">
 *       <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
 *       <summary>A greeting</summary>
 *       <description>
 *         Greeting of the invading martians
 *       </description>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name="box" type="(ii)">
 *       <default>(20,30)</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name="empty-string" type="s">
 *       <default>""</default>
 *       <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
 *     </key>
 *
 *   </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ```
 *
 * An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
 * ```xml
 * <schemalist>
 *
 *   <enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum">
 *     <value nick="first" value="1"/>
 *     <value nick="second" value="2"/>
 *   </enum>
 *
 *   <flags id="org.gtk.Test.myflags">
 *     <value nick="flag1" value="1"/>
 *     <value nick="flag2" value="2"/>
 *     <value nick="flag3" value="4"/>
 *   </flags>
 *
 *   <schema id="org.gtk.Test">
 *
 *     <key name="key-with-range" type="i">
 *       <range min="1" max="100"/>
 *       <default>10</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name="key-with-choices" type="s">
 *       <choices>
 *         <choice value='Elisabeth'/>
 *         <choice value='Annabeth'/>
 *         <choice value='Joe'/>
 *       </choices>
 *       <aliases>
 *         <alias value='Anna' target='Annabeth'/>
 *         <alias value='Beth' target='Elisabeth'/>
 *       </aliases>
 *       <default>'Joe'</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name='enumerated-key' enum='org.gtk.Test.myenum'>
 *       <default>'first'</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name='flags-key' flags='org.gtk.Test.myflags'>
 *       <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
 *     </key>
 *   </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Vendor overrides
 *
 * Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
 * an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
 * to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
 * is inconvenient and error-prone,
 * [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html) reads so-called ‘vendor
 * override’ files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
 * schema sources which can override default values. The schema ID serves
 * as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
 * serialized [struct@GLib.Variant] form, as in the following example:
 * ```
 * [org.gtk.Example]
 * key1='string'
 * key2=1.5
 * ```
 *
 * `glib-compile-schemas` expects schema files to have the extension
 * `.gschema.override`.
 *
 * ## Binding
 *
 * A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind [class@GObject.Object]
 * properties directly to settings, using [method@Gio.Settings.bind]. Once a
 * [class@GObject.Object] property has been bound to a setting, changes on
 * either side are automatically propagated to the other side. GSettings handles
 * details like mapping between [class@GObject.Object] and [struct@GLib.Variant]
 * types, and preventing infinite cycles.
 *
 * This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
 * underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
 * looks for a boolean property with the name `sensitivity` and
 * automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
 * If this ‘magic’ gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
 * `G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY` flag.
 *
 * ## Relocatable schemas
 *
 * A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
 * `<schema>` element. By using [ctor@Gio.Settings.new_with_path], a `GSettings`
 * object can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
 * instance. Paths passed to [ctor@Gio.Settings.new_with_path] will typically be
 * constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
 * identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
 * be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
 * dependency library.
 *
 * For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
 * for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
 * `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
 * they can be specified as `<child>` elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
 * ```xml
 * <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
 *   <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
 * </schema>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Build system integration
 *
 * GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
 * installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
 * following to your `configure.ac`:
 * ```
 * GLIB_GSETTINGS
 * ```
 *
 * In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
 * install the named schema:
 * ```
 * gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
 *
 * @GSETTINGS_RULES@
 * ```
 *
 * No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
 * translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
 * be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
 * 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
 * ```
 * data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
 * ```
 * [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ```
 *
 * GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the `<summary>` and
 * `<description>` elements, and also any `<default>` elements which have a
 * `l10n` attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml`
 * file by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
 * `.gschema.xml.in` template.
 *
 * If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
 * schema, it can either be defined manually using an `<enum>` element in the
 * schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
 * approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
 * synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
 * ```
 * gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
 * gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
 * ```
 *
 * `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
 * which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
 * `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
 * automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
 * rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
 * `EXTRA_DIST`.
 *
