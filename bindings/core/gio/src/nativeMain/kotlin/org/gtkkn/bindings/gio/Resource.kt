/**
 * Applications and libraries often contain binary or textual data that is
 * really part of the application, rather than user data. For instance
 * [`GtkBuilder`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Builder.html) `.ui` files,
 * splashscreen images, [class@Gio.Menu] markup XML, CSS files, icons, etc.
 * These are often shipped as files in `$datadir/appname`, or manually
 * included as literal strings in the code.
 *
 * The `GResource` API and the
 * [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) program provide a
 * convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties.
 * You maintain the files as normal files, so it’s easy to edit them, but during
 * the build the files are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the
 * executable. This means that loading the resource files are efficient (as they
 * are already in memory, shared with other instances) and simple (no need to
 * check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
 * also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.
 *
 * Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included
 * in the resource bundle in a compressed form, but will be automatically
 * uncompressed when the resource is used. This is very useful e.g. for larger
 * text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.
 *
 * Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
 * `preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
 * The only options currently supported are:
 *
 *  - `xml-stripblanks` which will use the [`xmllint`](man:xmllint(1)) command
 *    to strip ignorable whitespace from the XML file. For this to work,
 *    the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
 *    the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
 *    the preprocessing step is skipped.
 *
 *  - `to-pixdata` (deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32) which will use the
 *    `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` command to convert images to the [`GdkPixdata`](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/class.Pixdata.html)
 *    format, which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside
 *    the resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy of it. For this, the
 *    `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` program must be in the `PATH`, or the
 *    `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be set to the full path to
 *    the `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` executable; otherwise the resource compiler will
 *    abort. `to-pixdata` has been deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32, as
 *    `GResource` supports embedding modern image formats just as well. Instead
 *    of using it, embed a PNG or SVG file in your `GResource`.
 *
 *  - `json-stripblanks` which will use the
 *    [`json-glib-format`](man:json-glib-format(1)) command to strip ignorable
 *    whitespace from the JSON file. For this to work, the `JSON_GLIB_FORMAT`
 *    environment variable must be set to the full path to the
 *    `json-glib-format` executable, or it must be in the `PATH`; otherwise the
 *    preprocessing step is skipped. In addition, at least version 1.6 of
 *    `json-glib-format` is required.
 *
 * Resource files will be exported in the `GResource` namespace using the
 * combination of the given `prefix` and the filename from the `file` element.
 * The `alias` attribute can be used to alter the filename to expose them at a
 * different location in the resource namespace. Typically, this is used to
 * include files from a different source directory without exposing the source
 * directory in the resource namespace, as in the example below.
 *
 * Resource bundles are created by the
 * [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) program
 * which takes an XML file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that
 * the XML references. These are combined into a binary resource bundle.
 *
 * An example resource description:
 * ```xml
 * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 * <gresources>
 *   <gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example">
 *     <file>data/splashscreen.png</file>
 *     <file compressed="true">dialog.ui</file>
 *     <file preprocess="xml-stripblanks">menumarkup.xml</file>
 *     <file alias="example.css">data/example.css</file>
 *   </gresource>
 * </gresources>
 * ```
 *
 * This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
 * ```
 * /org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
 * /org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
 * /org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
 * /org/gtk/Example/example.css
 * ```
 *
 * Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use
 * Java-style path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.
 *
 * You can then use [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) to
 * compile the XML to a binary bundle that you can load with
 * [func@Gio.Resource.load]. However, it’s more common to use the
 * `--generate-source` and `--generate-header` arguments to create a source file
 * and header to link directly into your application.
 * This will generate `get_resource()`, `register_resource()` and
 * `unregister_resource()` functions, prefixed by the `--c-name` argument passed
 * to [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html). `get_resource()`
 * returns the generated `GResource` object. The register and unregister
 * functions register the resource so its files can be accessed using
 * [func@Gio.resources_lookup_data].
 *
 * Once a `GResource` has been created and registered all the data in it can be
 * accessed globally in the process by using API calls like
 * [func@Gio.resources_open_stream] to stream the data or
 * [func@Gio.resources_lookup_data] to get a direct pointer to the data. You can
 * also use URIs like `resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png` with
 * [iface@Gio.File] to access the resource data.
 *
 * Some higher-level APIs, such as [`GtkApplication`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html),
 * will automatically load resources from certain well-known paths in the
 * resource namespace as a convenience. See the documentation for those APIs
 * for details.
 *
 * There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the
 * compiler support for constructor and destructor functions (where available)
 * to automatically create and register the `GResource` on startup or library
 * load time. If you pass `--manual-register`, two functions to
 * register/unregister the resource are created instead. This requires an
 * explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all
 * platforms, even on the minor ones where constructors are not supported.
 * (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, Mac OS and Linux.)
 *
 * Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a
 * library, so if you are unloading libraries during runtime you need to be very
 * careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes
 * away when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally
 * a problem, since most resource accesses are for your own resources, and
 * resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.
 *
 * # Overlays
 *
 * When debugging a program or testing a change to an installed version, it is
 * often useful to be able to replace resources in the program or library,
 * without recompiling, for debugging or quick hacking and testing purposes.
 * Since GLib 2.50, it is possible to use the `G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS` environment
 * variable to selectively overlay resources with replacements from the
 * filesystem.  It is a `G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR`-separated list of substitutions
 * to perform during resource lookups. It is ignored when running in a setuid
 * process.
 *
 * A substitution has the form
 *
 * ```
 * /org/gtk/libgtk=/home/desrt/gtk-overlay
 * ```
 *
 * The part before the `=` is the resource subpath for which the overlay
 * applies.  The part after is a filesystem path which contains files and
 * subdirectories as you would like to be loaded as resources with the
 * equivalent names.
 *
 * In the example above, if an application tried to load a resource with the
 * resource path `/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui` then `GResource` would check
 * the filesystem path `/home/desrt/gtk-overlay/ui/gtkdialog.ui`.  If a file was
 * found there, it would be used instead.  This is an overlay, not an outright
 * replacement, which means that if a file is not found at that path, the
 * built-in version will be used instead.  Whiteouts are not currently
 * supported.
 *
 * Substitutions must start with a slash, and must not contain a trailing slash
 * before the `=`.  The path after the slash should ideally be absolute, but
 * this is not strictly required.  It is possible to overlay the location of a
 * single resource with an individual file.
