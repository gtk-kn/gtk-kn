/**
 * The type of record that g_resolver_lookup_records() or
 * g_resolver_lookup_records_async() should retrieve. The records are returned
 * as lists of #GVariant tuples. Each record type has different values in
 * the variant tuples returned.
 *
 * %G_RESOLVER_RECORD_SRV records are returned as variants with the signature
 * `(qqqs)`, containing a `guint16` with the priority, a `guint16` with the
 * weight, a `guint16` with the port, and a string of the hostname.
 *
 * %G_RESOLVER_RECORD_MX records are returned as variants with the signature
 * `(qs)`, representing a `guint16` with the preference, and a string containing
 * the mail exchanger hostname.
 *
 * %G_RESOLVER_RECORD_TXT records are returned as variants with the signature
 * `(as)`, representing an array of the strings in the text record. Note: Most TXT
 * records only contain a single string, but
 * [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.3.14) does allow a
 * record to contain multiple strings. The RFC which defines the interpretation
 * of a specific TXT record will likely require concatenation of multiple
 * strings if they are present, as with
 * [RFC 7208](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-3.3).
 *
 * %G_RESOLVER_RECORD_SOA records are returned as variants with the signature
 * `(ssuuuuu)`, representing a string containing the primary name server, a
 * string containing the administrator, the serial as a `guint32`, the refresh
 * interval as a `guint32`, the retry interval as a `guint32`, the expire timeout
 * as a `guint32`, and the TTL as a `guint32`.
 *
 * %G_RESOLVER_RECORD_NS records are returned as variants with the signature
 * `(s)`, representing a string of the hostname of the name server.
 * @since 2.34
