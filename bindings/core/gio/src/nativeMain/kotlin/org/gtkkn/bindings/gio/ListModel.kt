/**
 * `GListModel` is an interface that represents a mutable list of
 * [class@GObject.Object]. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets
 * in user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
 * convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
 * updates.
 *
 * Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
 * mechanism (normally the [signal@GObject.Object::notify] signal).  Taken
 * together with the [signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed] signal, this provides
 * for a list that can change its membership, and in which the members can
 * change their individual properties.
 *
 * A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
 * points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
 * signal strength.
 *
 * It is important to note that the `GListModel` itself does not report
 * changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
 * membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
 * then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
 * interested in.
 *
 * All items in a `GListModel` are of (or derived from) the same type.
 * [method@Gio.ListModel.get_item_type] returns that type.  The type may be an
 * interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
 *
 * The semantics are close to that of an array:
 * [method@Gio.ListModel.get_n_items] returns the number of items in the list
 * and [method@Gio.ListModel.get_item] returns an item at a (0-based) position.
 * In order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
 * you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
 * [method@Gio.ListModel.get_item] until it returns `NULL`.
 *
 * An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
 * return the same object for a given position until all references to
 * it are gone.
 *
 * On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
 * objects that are currently ‘user visible’, in order to facilitate the
 * maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
 * reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
 *
 * This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
 * thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
 * implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
 * the thread-default main context (see
 * [method@GLib.MainContext.push_thread_default]) in effect at the time that the
 * model was created.
 *
 * Over time, it has established itself as good practice for list model
 * implementations to provide properties `item-type` and `n-items` to
 * ease working with them. While it is not required, it is recommended
 * that implementations provide these two properties. They should return
 * the values of [method@Gio.ListModel.get_item_type] and
 * [method@Gio.ListModel.get_n_items] respectively and be defined as such:
 *
 * ```c
 * properties[PROP_ITEM_TYPE] =
 *   g_param_spec_gtype ("item-type", NULL, NULL, G_TYPE_OBJECT,
 *                       G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY | G_PARAM_READWRITE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
 * properties[PROP_N_ITEMS] =
 *   g_param_spec_uint ("n-items", NULL, NULL, 0, G_MAXUINT, 0,
 *                      G_PARAM_READABLE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
 * ```
