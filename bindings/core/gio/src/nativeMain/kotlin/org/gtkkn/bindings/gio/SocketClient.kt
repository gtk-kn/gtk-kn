/**
 * `GSocketClient` is a lightweight high-level utility class for connecting to
 * a network host using a connection oriented socket type.
 *
 * You create a `GSocketClient` object, set any options you want, and then
 * call a sync or async connect operation, which returns a
 * [class@Gio.SocketConnection] subclass on success.
 *
 * The type of the [class@Gio.SocketConnection] object returned depends on the
 * type of the underlying socket that is in use. For instance, for a TCP/IP
 * connection it will be a [class@Gio.TcpConnection].
 *
 * As `GSocketClient` is a lightweight object, you don't need to cache it. You
 * can just create a new one any time you need one.

     *   with a proxy to get it to connect to @connectable. @connection is

     *   connection to @connectable through a proxy server. @connection is
     *   the stream returned from g_proxy_connect(), which may or may not
     *   be a #GSocketConnection.

     * - %G_SOCKET_CLIENT_TLS_HANDSHAKING: @client is about to begin a TLS
     *   handshake. @connection is a #GTlsClientConnection.
