/**
 * Virtual table for handling properties and method calls for a D-Bus
 * interface.
 *
 * Since 2.38, if you want to handle getting/setting D-Bus properties
 * asynchronously, give null as your get_property() or set_property()
 * function. The D-Bus call will be directed to your @method_call function,
 * with the provided @interface_name set to "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties".
 *
 * Ownership of the #GDBusMethodInvocation object passed to the
 * method_call() function is transferred to your handler; you must
 * call one of the methods of #GDBusMethodInvocation to return a reply
 * (possibly empty), or an error. These functions also take ownership
 * of the passed-in invocation object, so unless the invocation
 * object has otherwise been referenced, it will be then be freed.
 * Calling one of these functions may be done within your
 * method_call() implementation but it also can be done at a later
 * point to handle the method asynchronously.
 *
 * The usual checks on the validity of the calls is performed. For
 * `Get` calls, an error is automatically returned if the property does
 * not exist or the permissions do not allow access. The same checks are
 * performed for `Set` calls, and the provided value is also checked for
 * being the correct type.
 *
 * For both `Get` and `Set` calls, the #GDBusMethodInvocation
 * passed to the @method_call handler can be queried with
 * g_dbus_method_invocation_get_property_info() to get a pointer
 * to the #GDBusPropertyInfo of the property.
 *
 * If you have readable properties specified in your interface info,
 * you must ensure that you either provide a non-null @get_property()
 * function or provide implementations of both the `Get` and `GetAll`
 * methods on org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties interface in your @method_call
 * function. Note that the required return type of the `Get` call is
 * `(v)`, not the type of the property. `GetAll` expects a return value
 * of type `a{sv}`.
 *
 * If you have writable properties specified in your interface info,
 * you must ensure that you either provide a non-null @set_property()
 * function or provide an implementation of the `Set` call. If implementing
 * the call, you must return the value of type %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UNIT.
