/**
 * Stores geometrical information for a series of rows in a GtkCellArea
 *
 * The `GtkCellAreaContext` object is created by a given `GtkCellArea`
 * implementation via its `GtkCellAreaClass.create_context()` virtual
 * method and is used to store cell sizes and alignments for a series of
 * `GtkTreeModel` rows that are requested and rendered in the same context.
 *
 * `GtkCellLayout` widgets can create any number of contexts in which to
 * request and render groups of data rows. However, it’s important that the
 * same context which was used to request sizes for a given `GtkTreeModel`
 * row also be used for the same row when calling other `GtkCellArea` APIs
 * such as gtk_cell_area_render() and gtk_cell_area_event().
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation
 *

 * - parameter `minimum_height`: minimum_height: Out parameter is not supported
