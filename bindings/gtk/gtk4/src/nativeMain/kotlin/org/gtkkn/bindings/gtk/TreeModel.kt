/**
 * The tree interface used by GtkTreeView
 *
 * The `GtkTreeModel` interface defines a generic tree interface for
 * use by the `GtkTreeView` widget. It is an abstract interface, and
 * is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
 * programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
 * type for it to be viewable by a `GtkTreeView` widget.
 *
 * The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
 * columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
 * every node has different values depending on which column is being
 * queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
 * the GType system (ie. %G_TYPE_INT, %GTK_TYPE_BUTTON, %G_TYPE_POINTER,
 * etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
 * important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
 * a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
 * model decides how and if changes are made.
 *
 * In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
 * write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
 * — the `GtkTreeStore` and the `GtkListStore`. To use these, the
 * developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
 * models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
 * interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
 * storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
 * these two models are sufficient.
 *
 * Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
 * query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
 * column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
 * particular node in a model. They are the [struct@Gtk.TreePath] and
 * the [struct@Gtk.TreeIter] (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
 * interface consists of operations on a [struct@Gtk.TreeIter].
 *
 * A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
 * that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
 * model. A [struct@Gtk.TreePath] can be converted into either an
 * array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
 * of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
 * at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
 * node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
 * the third node.
 *
 * By contrast, a [struct@Gtk.TreeIter] is a reference to a specific node on
 * a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
 * generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
 * way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
 * gtk_tree_model_get_iter(). These iterators are the primary way
 * of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
 * `GtkTextBuffer`. They are generally statically allocated on the
 * stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
 * a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
 *
 * It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
 * For example, the `GtkListStore` model, which is internally a simple
 * linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
 * `GtkTreeModel`Sort stores an array and an offset in two of the
 * pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
 * generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
 * catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
 *
 * The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
 * Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
 * is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
 * to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
 * free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
 * guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
 * to is valid (most notably the `GtkTreeStore` and `GtkListStore`).
 * Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
 * the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
 * important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
 * As a result, the %GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to
 * indicate this behavior.
 *
 * To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
 * provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
 * the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
 * easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
 * callbacks.
 *
 * ## Acquiring a `GtkTreeIter`
 *
 * ```c
 * // Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
 * GtkTreePath *path;
 * GtkTreeIter iter;
 * GtkTreeIter parent_iter;
 *
 * // get the iterator from a string
 * gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
 *                                      &iter,
 *                                      "3:2:5");
 *
 * // get the iterator from a path
 * path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
 * gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
 * gtk_tree_path_free (path);
 *
 * // walk the tree to find the iterator
 * gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
 *                                NULL, 3);
 * parent_iter = iter;
 * gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
 *                                &parent_iter, 2);
 * parent_iter = iter;
 * gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
 *                                &parent_iter, 5);
 * ```
 *
 * This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
 * and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
 * populate_model() function used below is not
 * shown, as it is specific to the `GtkListStore`. For information on
 * how to write such a function, see the `GtkListStore` documentation.
 *
 * ## Reading data from a `GtkTreeModel`
 *
 * ```c
 * enum
 * {
 *   STRING_COLUMN,
 *   INT_COLUMN,
 *   N_COLUMNS
 * };
 *
 * ...
 *
 * GtkTreeModel *list_store;
 * GtkTreeIter iter;
 * gboolean valid;
 * int row_count = 0;
 *
 * // make a new list_store
 * list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
 *                                  G_TYPE_STRING,
 *                                  G_TYPE_INT);
 *
 * // Fill the list store with data
 * populate_model (list_store);
 *
 * // Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
 * // through the list, reading each row.
 *
 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store,
 *                                        &iter);
 * while (valid)
 *  {
 *    char *str_data;
 *    int    int_data;
 *
 *    // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
 *    gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
 *                        STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
 *                        INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
 *                        -1);
 *
 *    // Do something with the data
 *    g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n",
 *             row_count, str_data, int_data);
 *    g_free (str_data);
 *
 *    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
 *                                      &iter);
 *    row_count++;
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * The `GtkTreeModel` interface contains two methods for reference
 * counting: gtk_tree_model_ref_node() and gtk_tree_model_unref_node().
 * These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
 * is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
 * displayed. `GtkTreeView` will take a reference on a node when it is
 * visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
 * Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
 * visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
 * scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
 * a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
 * not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
 * folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
 *
 * When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
 * into account:
 *
 * - Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
 *   This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
 *   as well.
 *
 * - Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
 *   possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
 *   row-deleted signal is received.
 *
 * - Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
 *   siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
 *   required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
 *   however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
 *   is always referenced when any view is attached).
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation
 *
 * - method `get`: Varargs parameter is not supported
 * - parameter `var_args`: va_list
 * - parameter `new_order`: Array parameter of type gint is not supported
