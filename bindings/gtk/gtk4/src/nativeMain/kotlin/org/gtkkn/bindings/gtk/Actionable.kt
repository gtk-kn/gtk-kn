/**
 * The `GtkActionable` interface provides a convenient way of associating
 * widgets with actions.
 *
 * It primarily consists of two properties: [property@Gtk.Actionable:action-name]
 * and [property@Gtk.Actionable:action-target]. There are also some convenience
 * APIs for setting these properties.
 *
 * The action will be looked up in action groups that are found among
 * the widgets ancestors. Most commonly, these will be the actions with
 * the “win.” or “app.” prefix that are associated with the
 * `GtkApplicationWindow` or `GtkApplication`, but other action groups that
 * are added with [method@Gtk.Widget.insert_action_group] will be consulted
 * as well.
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation
 *
 * - method `set_action_target`: Varargs parameter is not supported
 * - method `action-target`: Property has no getter nor setter
