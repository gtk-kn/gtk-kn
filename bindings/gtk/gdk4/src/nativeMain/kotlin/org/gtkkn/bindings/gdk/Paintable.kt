/**
 * `GdkPaintable` is a simple interface used by GTK to represent content that
 * can be painted.
 *
 * The content of a `GdkPaintable` can be painted anywhere at any size
 * without requiring any sort of layout. The interface is inspired by
 * similar concepts elsewhere, such as
 * [ClutterContent](https://developer.gnome.org/clutter/stable/ClutterContent.html),
 * [HTML/CSS Paint Sources](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-4/#paint-source),
 * or [SVG Paint Servers](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/pservers.html).
 *
 * A `GdkPaintable` can be snapshot at any time and size using
 * [method@Gdk.Paintable.snapshot]. How the paintable interprets that size and
 * if it scales or centers itself into the given rectangle is implementation
 * defined, though if you are implementing a `GdkPaintable` and don't know what
 * to do, it is suggested that you scale your paintable ignoring any potential
 * aspect ratio.
 *
 * The contents that a `GdkPaintable` produces may depend on the [class@Gdk.Snapshot]
 * passed to it. For example, paintables may decide to use more detailed images
 * on higher resolution screens or when OpenGL is available. A `GdkPaintable`
 * will however always produce the same output for the same snapshot.
 *
 * A `GdkPaintable` may change its contents, meaning that it will now produce
 * a different output with the same snapshot. Once that happens, it will call
 * [method@Gdk.Paintable.invalidate_contents] which will emit the
 * [signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-contents] signal. If a paintable is known
 * to never change its contents, it will set the %GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_CONTENTS
 * flag. If a consumer cannot deal with changing contents, it may call
 * [method@Gdk.Paintable.get_current_image] which will return a static
 * paintable and use that.
 *
 * A paintable can report an intrinsic (or preferred) size or aspect ratio it
 * wishes to be rendered at, though it doesn't have to. Consumers of the interface
 * can use this information to layout thepaintable appropriately. Just like the
 * contents, the size of a paintable can change. A paintable will indicate this
 * by calling [method@Gdk.Paintable.invalidate_size] which will emit the
 * [signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-size] signal. And just like for contents,
 * if a paintable is known to never change its size, it will set the
 * %GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_SIZE flag.
 *
 * Besides API for applications, there are some functions that are only
 * useful for implementing subclasses and should not be used by applications:
 * [method@Gdk.Paintable.invalidate_contents],
 * [method@Gdk.Paintable.invalidate_size],
 * [func@Gdk.Paintable.new_empty].
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation
 *
 * - parameter `concrete_width`: concrete_width: Out parameter is not supported
