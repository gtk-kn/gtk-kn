/**
 * Record definition, equivalent to a C struct, that is a simple structure, not a class.
 *
 * @property info a [GirInfo] that a record can contain.
 * @property name name of the record.
 * @property cType corresponding C type of the record.
 * @property disguised deprecated. Binary attribute to tell if the record is disguised, i.e. whether the c:type is a
 *                     typedef that doesn't look like a pointer, but is one internally. Its second meaning is "private"
 *                     and is set when any typedef struct is parsed which doesn't also include a full struct with fields
 *                     (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection/issues/101).
 *                     Replaced by "opaque" and "pointer".
 * @property opaque true for a typedef struct that does not have a corresponding public structure definition.
 * @property pointer true for a typedef struct pointer, e.g. `typedef struct Foo* FooPtr`.
 * @property glibTypeName GObject compatible C type of the record.
 * @property glibGetType function to get the GObject compatible type of the record.
 * @property cSymbolPrefix prefix to filter out from C functions. For example, gtk_window_new will lose gtk_.
 * @property foreign true if the record is foreign, that it is not available in a g-i supported library.
 * @property glibIsGtypeStructFor name of the GObject compatible gtype this record represents. If empty, this record
 *                                will be hidden from generated public APIs.
 * @property copyFunction name of the function used to copy the record.
 * @property freeFunction name of the function used to free the record.
 * @property fields a list of [GirField] that a record can contain.
 * @property functions a list of [GirFunction] that a record can contain.
 * @property unions a list of [GirUnion] that a record can contain.
 * @property methods a list of [GirMethod] that a record can contain.
 * @property constructors a list of [GirConstructor] that a record can contain.
