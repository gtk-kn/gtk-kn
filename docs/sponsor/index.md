title: Sponsor gtk-kn
description: Support the gtk-kn project by making a donation to help cover infrastructure costs, hosting, and build optimizations.

The gtk-kn project relies on community support to cover maintenance costs, such as domain registrations,
hosting, and infrastructure. While [:material-gitlab: GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/join/)
provides free hosting for our website and build servers, we aim to set up
a [Gradle Build Cache Node](https://docs.gradle.com/build-cache-node/) on a dedicated VPS to speed up builds and
improve development efficiency.

## How to Donate

We accept donations via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gtk-kn), an open and transparent funding
platform for open-source projects:

## Why Open Collective?

Open Collective is a platform designed to help open-source projects raise, manage, and spend money transparently. Unlike
traditional crowdfunding, it supports ongoing contributions and ensures that every donation is openly tracked in a
public ledger.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Benefits of Open Collective:**

- **Full transparency** â€“ Anyone can see how funds are collected and spent.
- **Supports ongoing collaboration** â€“ Funds remain available even if maintainers change.
- **Hassle-free donations** â€“ No need to worry about legal or tax complexities.

Our fiscal host, [Open Source Collective](https://oscollective.org/), securely processes all donations.
