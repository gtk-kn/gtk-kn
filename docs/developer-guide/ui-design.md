Designing beautiful and modern GTK applications requires a consistent and user-friendly approach.
Fortunately, there are well-established guidelines and design resources that can help you create apps that integrate
seamlessly with the GNOME ecosystem.

## GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)

The [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) (HIG) are the primary source of design
documentation for developers building software with GTK and the GNOME platform. These guidelines are useful for:

- App designers & developers looking to create intuitive and accessible interfaces.
- Understanding GNOME UX and how to build apps that feel native on Linux.

### What’s Inside the HIG?

- **Design Principles** – Core rules and goals for GNOME app design.
- **Resources** – Tools and assets to assist in GNOME UI design.
- **Guidelines** – Standard UI/UX conventions, including icons, typography, and input handling.
- **Patterns** – UI elements such as windows, buttons, notifications, and navigation.
- **Reference** – Standard keyboard shortcuts and UI color recommendations.

Following these guidelines ensures that your GTK apps are **modern, accessible, and visually cohesive** with the GNOME
desktop.
