# Widgets

In GTK4, a widget is a graphical user interface (GUI) component that forms the building blocks of an applicationâ€™s
interface. These reusable components help create a consistent look and feel and include elements like buttons, text
boxes, and menus.

GTK4 widgets are object-oriented, allowing customization through properties and signals:

- **Properties** manage and retrieve widget states.
- **Signals** enable widgets to respond to events like user input or state changes.

Widgets are organized hierarchically, typically starting with a top-level window containing other widgets arranged in a
layout.

GTK4 provides a wide range of pre-built widgets, such as buttons, text boxes, labels, combo boxes, and tree views, that
can be used immediately. It also supports creating custom widgets by subclassing existing ones or building new widgets
from scratch.

In summary, GTK4 widgets offer a robust, flexible foundation for developing responsive, visually appealing user
interfaces for desktop and mobile applications.
