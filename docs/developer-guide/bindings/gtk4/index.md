# GTK4

[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) (GIMP Toolkit) is a widely used, free software toolkit for building graphical user
interfaces (GUIs). Initially created for the GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program), GTK has evolved into a versatile
toolkit for creating GUIs on Linux, Unix, and Windows. It is developed and maintained by
the [GNOME Project](https://www.gnome.org/), which also powers a popular desktop environment for Linux-based systems.

GTK4, the latest version of the toolkit, was released in December 2020. Key updates include:

- **Vulkan Graphics API (experimental)**: Enhanced performance with hardware acceleration and better GPU support.
- **New Layout Manager**: More flexibility in arranging widgets, making interface design simpler and more adaptable.
- **New Widgets**: Components like GtkListView allow easy data display in lists.
- **Improved Internationalization**: Expanded language support.

GTK4 offers a robust toolkit for creating user interfaces with extensive system-level access and a wide array of widgets
for building desktop applications. Its new features make it an ideal choice for modern, high-performance UI development
on Linux, Unix, and Windows.
