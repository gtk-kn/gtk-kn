# Adwaita

[Adwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/) (Libadwaita or Adw) is a set of widgets and classes that
extend the GTK toolkit, the default UI toolkit for GNOME. It’s designed to implement GNOME’s design patterns, as
outlined in the [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) (HIG). The HIG provides
recommendations for creating consistent, intuitive, and accessible user interfaces across GNOME applications.

Adwaita offers a range of HIG-compliant widgets, including buttons, switches, and dialogs, that give applications a
consistent and modern GNOME look. It supports high-resolution displays, with scalable icons for clarity on various
screen sizes.

In addition to widgets, Adwaita includes CSS stylesheets that define their visual appearance, offering a flexible way to
customize styling while following GNOME’s guidelines. Adwaita also supports dark mode, which can be toggled system-wide
or on a per-application basis.

Overall, Adwaita is crucial for GNOME, providing a cohesive, modern look that aligns with the GNOME HIG. With support
for high-resolution displays and dark mode, it’s a versatile toolkit for building modern, user-friendly desktop
applications.
