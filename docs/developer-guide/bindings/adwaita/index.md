[Adwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/) (also known as **Libadwaita** or **Adw**) is a set of
widgets and classes that extend the GTK toolkit, the default UI framework for GNOME applications.

It is designed to implement GNOME’s design patterns, as outlined in
the [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) (HIG). These guidelines ensure consistency,
intuitiveness, and accessibility across GNOME applications. For a deeper dive into designing modern GTK applications,
