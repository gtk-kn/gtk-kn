GTK 4 is a widely used cross-platform widget toolkit written in C. With GObject-Introspection, GTK’s API becomes
accessible to multiple programming languages.

The `gtk-kn` project offers Kotlin/Native bindings for various GTK-related libraries, which are utilized throughout this
user guide.

## Who This Guide is For

This guide assumes familiarity with [Kotlin Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html). If you’re new to
Kotlin, the [introductory documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/learning-materials-overview.html) is a helpful
starting point, especially if you have experience in languages like Python or Swift.

A desire to develop graphical applications and basic knowledge of Kotlin/Native is all you’ll need to benefit from this
guide.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is designed to be read sequentially. However, if you’re using it as a reference, feel free to jump to
specific topics as needed.

We aim to introduce key GTK concepts with practical examples. Occasionally, you’ll find less practical examples where
they help explain complex concepts more clearly. For focused examples, refer to the relevant section in the `gtk-kn`
repository.
